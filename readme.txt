Translate your WordPress site in context and launch localized versions of your website the quick and easy way. 

== Description ==

The problem with most existing WordPress website translation plugins is that they require programming effort to localize your theme, and more programming as you maintain those localized sites. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just click the content you want translated and enter translations directly on top of your site? If you're tired of syncing your resource files and want a more intuitive way of localizing your site then this plugin is for you.

= In-context website translation = 

Our visual editor highlights all translatable content on your website and allows you to translate it in context, with machine translations offered as suggestions. Once your translation cycle is done, you can launch your translated websites directly from our platform.
